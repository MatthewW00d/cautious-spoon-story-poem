This was the  first line of my story
my two contributions were quite borey.
An assimilated spoon who swore there was no moon
wished it was a knife or a fork
as that would have been a boon.
Instead it mustered that it was doomed to scoop up custard
Then spent nights yelling 'Ye busted' 
in the light of the silvery Death Star (tm)
