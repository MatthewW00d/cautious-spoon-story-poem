There once was a spoon full of stardust 
that was bragging around
the other spoons felt jealous, so they gave him a sout
"Hey spoon full of stardust, stop boasting about!
or else we will get angry and you will remain without!"
Unfortunately the spoon full of stardust couldn't comply
and its peers a lesson desided to apply!
